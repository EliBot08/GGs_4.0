Administrator elevation (user consent via UAC prompt)

Your app manifest requests requireAdministrator.

The user explicitly approves when launching.

This gives your app rights to all files, registry hives, and processes accessible to Administrators.

Windows Service running as LocalSystem

Installed by your app (with the user’s permission).

Runs with SYSTEM privileges — the most powerful built-in account in Windows.

This can do more than Administrator accounts (e.g., manage services, access protected registry keys, work before logon).

Kernel-mode driver (signed, installed with user consent)

For true “every inch” access, you need a driver.

A driver runs in ring 0 (kernel mode), which means it can directly interact with hardware, memory, filesystem, networking stack, etc.

To be legitimate:

Write it with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

Sign it with an EV code-signing certificate.

Package it in your installer so the user approves its installation.

Win32 + WMI + Registry APIs (via C# with P/Invoke)

Access low-level configuration safely.

Control processes, threads, scheduling, network, power, storage.

Use official APIs instead of hacks (safer and future-proof).
