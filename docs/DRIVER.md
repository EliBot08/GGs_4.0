# Kernel-Mode Driver â€“ Implementation Guide (Optional)

For capabilities that require kernel-mode (ring 0) access, implement a signed Windows driver.

## Prerequisites
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) matching your Visual Studio and SDK versions.
- EV Code Signing Certificate (required for cross-signing and Windows 10/11).
- Hardware/Driver signing portal access for attestation signing if needed.

## Steps
1) Create a new KMDF driver project in Visual Studio (WDK template).
2) Implement only the minimal, carefully-audited capabilities you truly need. Avoid arbitrary read/write.
3) Define a stable IOCTL contract (IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL) to expose safe, purpose-built operations.
4) Validate all pointers and lengths; never trust user-mode buffers.
5) Build in Release; sign with EV cert; submit for attestation if required.
6) Package with an INF; install via `pnputil /add-driver your.inf /install` with user consent.
7) Add uninstall steps and roll-back procedures.

## Security Notes
- Ensure strict ACLs on the device interface (e.g., only Administrators can open handles).
- Log all privileged operations in the Windows Event Log.
- Provide a kill switch to disable the driver quickly if needed.
